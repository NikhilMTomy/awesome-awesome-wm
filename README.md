# Awesome Awesome WM [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of high-quality tools/scripts/configs for Awesome Window Manager.

This guide was created because out-of-the-box Awesome WM experience is miserable, yet the WM quickly grows on those courageous enough to tinker with it and weather version-incompatibility issues. This guide was created for those who need a head start with their awesome config.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
