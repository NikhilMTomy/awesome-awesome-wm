# Awesome Awesome WM [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of high-quality tools/scripts/configs for Awesome Window Manager.

This guide was created because out-of-the-box Awesome WM experience is miserable, yet the WM quickly grows on those courageous enough to tinker with it and weather version-incompatibility issues. This guide was created for those who need a head start with their awesome config.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

## Official Resources
- [Main repository](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) - latest development build
- [Wiki](http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Main_Page) - while not terse, a very useful resource

## Pre-Built Versions
- [Ubuntu/Mint](https://launchpad.net/~klaus-vormweg/+archive/ubuntu/awesome) - use this PPA instead of official which tends to be very old
- [All Other Linuxes](http://pkgs.org/download/awesome) - other distros are up-to-date here

## Configuration
- [Valid Key Names](http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/List_of_keysyms) - useful for figuring out things like `PgUp` is actually called `Prior`
- [Menu Replacement](https://github.com/terceiro/awesome-freedesktop) - unlike default menu that looks very basic compared to other window manager, this menu replaces the original with a more `Start`-like menu with icons

## Theming
- [Awesome Copycats](https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats) - a collection of well-polished themes with distinct look and feel
- [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) - high-performance compositor for those who like transparent windows

## Basic Widgets
- [Volume Icon](https://github.com/Maato/volumeicon) - stand-alone volume icon for lightweight WMs that fits well with nm-applet (C)
- [Network](https://github.com/plotnikovanton/net_widgets) - a wireless + wired network widget that replaces nm-applet (lua)
- [Battery](https://github.com/NuckChorris/assault/) - stand-alone battery widget (C)
- [Weather](https://github.com/ralluri/yawn) - retrieves localized weather information from Yahoo

## Productivity Widgets
- [Basic Calendar](https://github.com/cdump/awesome-calendar) - simple but pretty
- [Calendar w/ TODO](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/Orglendar) - (orglendar) a calendar + to-do list for awesome that reads entries from a .org file (I have a cronjob dumping my Google Calendar to that file) (lua)
- [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/optama/awmodoro) - hides clutter from the screen for 25 mins, replacing it with a progress bar (lua)

## Wanted
- widgets for cpu/memory monitoring, polished mail integration
- audio/mpd integration that's not overly complex like AwsoMPD
- more theme bundles to share (if you want to share your theme, I ask that you attach a screenshot to your repo)
